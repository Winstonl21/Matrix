# Matrix
In this project I implemented my own library for processing numerical matrices in the C programming language. Matrices are one of the basic data structures in programming, e.g. they are used to represent table values, for computational tasks and neural networks. As part of the project you will learn more about matrices and solidify knowledge of structured programming.
